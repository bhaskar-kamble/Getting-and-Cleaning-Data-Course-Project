Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
========================================

This repository contains the R code and documentation for the Assignment to Week 4 of the Course "Getting and Cleaning Data", part of the Data Science Specialization offered by Coursera. The Assignment uses Data from the [Human Activity Recogntion Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) data set, which is hosted at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/).


## Files

`run_analysis.R` contains the R code to perform the 5 steps of the assignment. Before running the code, please make sure it is in the same folder into which the data was extracted. (In other words, the working directory should contain the "test" and the "train" folders.) You can run it by typing the command: `source('run_analysis.R')`, followed by `run_analysis()`. 

`data_mean.txt` The output of the 5th step is stored in this file and which is included in this repository. This file was also uploaded during the submission process.

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
